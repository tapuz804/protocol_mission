E2EE
we want to make a protocol that will work for a server that needs this:
1. server that will listen to up to 10 clients.
2. server that can send a message to unconnected client and the client will answer the message afterwards
3. the messages will be encrypted and will be safe from MINM
4. need to choose between symetric or asymetryc encryption
5. first registeration.
6. making keys and passing them between the server and client
7. the message needs a checksum of some sort.
8. verify the message got there.
9. need to describe the message design (header, body ...)
10. describe the use of structers for the messages


How the protocol will work:
    1. client will send the secrect code. (secure channel)
    For each message we will add an id that will increse by one for each message 
    And each message will have a checksum for checking the message whole.
    2. client will send key signed
    3. server will verify the client key and work with that key.
    4. server will send the client his new password.
    5. client will send the password encrypted.
    6. server will save this client and will get messages from him and send messages.
